   - Try the X-Fi effect on previous generation sound cards.

 - Sound Blaster Cinema (SBX Pro Studio)

   - It is implemented for SBX Pro Studio effects. You can install and use the Sound Blaster Cinema control panel, but the THX TruStudio Pro control panel is still available. The same effect is applied with the THX TruStudio Pro control panel as with the SBX Pro Studio. I don't recommend installing the Sound Blaster Cinema control panel because it conflicts with some sound cards. (e.g. Sound Blaster X-Fi Notebook and etc.) Therefore, I recommend using the THX TruStudio Pro control panel.

 - DTS Connect Encoder / DTS Neo:PC Decoder and Dolby Digital Live for Sound Blaster Audigy 2 NX, Digital Music SX, Live! 24-bit External, MP3+ / Connect / Digital Music / Digital Music PX

   - Sound Blaster Audigy 2 NX, Digital Music SX, Live! 24-bit External, MP3+ / Connect / Digital Music / Digital Music PX does not originally support DDL or DTS Connect. This driver supports these as additional features.
